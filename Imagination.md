# Imagination for TAOCP

## Chapter 1 

### Section 1.1 

Introduce Euclid great common divider. Five features for algorithms: finitness, defined, input, output, effective. Compare algorithm with cookbook recipe. The mathematics definition for algorithms.

### Section 1.2 Mathematical Preniminaris

Involved in content from "Concrete Mathematics" by Graham, Knuth,and Patashnik, second edition (Reading, Mass.: Addison- Wesley, 1994).

#### Section 1.2.1 Mathematical Induction

From $1+3+...+(2n+1)=n^2$ introduce mathematical induction, then use Fibonacci sequence inequality enhance the process. Use extended Euclid Algorithm introduce the mathematical induction prove and flowchart with assertion. Introduce inductive assertion , invariants, weakest precondition, etc basic concepts.
